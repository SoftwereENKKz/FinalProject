The dataset includes 1239 images.
Landak are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (white edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -30 and +30 degrees
